# C_27_TicTacToe_WPF_TOMA

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The game allows two players to take turns marking the grid with 'X' or 'O' and checks for a winner after each move.

## Features
- Two-player mode (Player 1: X, Player 2: O)
- Visual representation of the 3x3 grid
- Game state tracking (player turns, number of plays)
- Winner detection and announcement
- Option to reset and start a new game
